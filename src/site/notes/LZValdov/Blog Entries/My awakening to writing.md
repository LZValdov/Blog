Among my earliest childhood memories, I recall my father seated at our dining table, immersed in reading or writing. As a curious child, eager to emulate him, I would join him, sketching or painting in my coloring books. As I learned to read, I'd sit beside him, though our 'reading sessions' often devolved into energetic chatter. At that age, reading held little allure; it had a tendency to lull me to sleep. Writing, however, remained a distant pursuit for several more years.

My first foray into extensive writing occurred in second grade, with a school assignment: an autobiography. The task, requiring handwritten text and illustrations, proved challenging. I struggled to organize events chronologically, but despite the effort, I was pleased with the result. Yet, it didn't ignite a lasting passion for writing.

Fast forward to ninth grade, in literature class. We were tasked with writing a romantic story. I set mine in the time of Aristotle, crafting a tale of star-crossed lovers separated by social barriers. My short story, just over a thousand words, won first place. While the recognition was gratifying, it wasn't enough to propel me into a writing career.

During my fifteenth summer, a family vacation to Nayarit, Mexico, became a turning point. I met Cecilia, a girl who captured my attention. After overcoming my initial shyness, we began dating. The distance between us prompted me to write love letters, as phone calls felt inadequate. My inspiration flowed, and I began writing poetry about everything. When Cecilia abruptly stopped responding, I continued writing for another month, before finally turning my focus inward.

My writing evolved, venturing into fiction. I started several stories, some of which remain unfinished to this day. In my Information Technologies program, a legal IT course required us to maintain a journal. This exercise redefined writing for me, allowing for unfiltered self-expression. The same class also taught us how to write business plans and corporate acts. During this time, I volunteered at the university's business incubator.

Initially, I reviewed entrepreneurs' applications, translating information into follow-up questions to refine their business plans. I then created their landing pages, mission and vision statements, and managed their web domains and hosting. After building nine client websites, I transitioned to documentation and direct client assistance, gaining expertise in crafting compelling business proposals and plans.

Throughout my university years, beyond academic assignments, I continued my journal and fiction writing. My vivid imagination, particularly my dreams, fueled my fiction. Over thirty-five years, I accumulated nineteen story ideas, but only two have been brought to completion.

Upon graduating in 2011, I entered a challenging job market. I took positions for which I was overqualified, and narrowly missed a physically demanding federal job that, in hindsight, would have stifled my writing. I continued writing my stories as a hobby. My next professional writing opportunity arose in 2018, in a maintenance department. I was tasked with creating a downtime analysis tool, requiring extensive documentation to ensure accurate database input.

This experience boosted my confidence in developing for enterprise clients. I also published my first novel in May 2020, during the pandemic. During that period, I worked on various projects, including more software documentation. I never considered writing as a viable business, keeping it as a personal pursuit. In 2023, a surgical recovery period allowed me to finish and publish my second novel.

It wasn't until I discovered Alexandra Fasulo's work that I realized my passion for writing could be a profession. Ironically, I wasn't searching for freelance opportunities; I was researching farming. Yet, her content illuminated the path I had overlooked. The answer was always there.
